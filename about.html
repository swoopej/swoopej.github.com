    <h2>Hey, I'm Julie.</h2>
    <p>I'm from Texas, lived on the West Coast for 6 years, now I live in Brooklyn, NY.  I had a close scrape with going to law school after college, but fortunately I escaped and learned how to program.  I recently completed Hacker School in New York, which was probably the most productive three months of my life.

    I tweet here, cook with my friends here, and take faux vintage photos here.  You can also just email me.</p>
