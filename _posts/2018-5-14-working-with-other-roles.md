Working with Product Managers
=====

Similar [my post about testing and mental blocks][1], going on a bunch of job interviews over the past few months helped me realize a few things about how I work with Product Managers.  It's a fairly obvious interview topic for an engineer with a few years experience, and it's one that's rarely talked about within organizations outside of interviews.  Agile "reflections????" are one venue where this _could_ happen, but in my experience it rarely does.  

Tension between product managers and engineers seems to be fairly common on development teams, and it's taken me working in different engineering roles on those teams to help understand where a lot of this tension comes from.  My experience at Kickstarter was definitely a learning experience in this regard.  I worked with four product managers who were all quite different.  Even when I was working with a product manager that I respect deeply and consider a friend, I occasionally found myself getting frustrated at how they were doing their job.  

Over time I realized that a lot of my frustration came from not understand the incentives that the PM was facing that I was not.  At a small or midsize company, a PM will frequently be in front of the executive team or even the CEO.  A lot can happen in those meetings that engineers may not see, and an offhand comment or two may be all the feedback that a PM gets on the current direction of the team that they are speaking on behalf of, and consequently it kind of serves as feedback for the PM has on how they are doing in their entire job.

That seems stressful.  The engineering equivalent might the CTO of a company pulling up an engineer's pull request in front of the whole engineering team and making a few offhand comments on it.  If you receive any sort of any sort of negative feedback in that venue, it might change your whole approach to a problem.  It's also not a great venue for the PM to try to change leadership's mind on a particular issue because there is such a large audience watching the whole event.

So as an engineering lead on a team or just an engineer who feels invested in the strategic direction of my team, it can be difficult when a PM makes decisions that I don't understand or don't agree with.
