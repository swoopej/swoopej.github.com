Helping Junior Engineers 
=====

This is part three of things that I am able to articulate more clearly after my recent job search.  Part one was [some ways I find testing useful][1] and part two was [about working with product managers][2].

Part three is about my experiences working with junior engineers and ways to make sure they are supported, especially as tech companies become more intentional about hiring engineers from underrepresented groups or people who have non-traditional paths to becoming an engineer.  I myself don't have a CS degree, and a lot of this is my own experience as well as more recently being a more senior engineer or tech lead on a team with people who are starting their first job as an engineer.

One thing that I have seen that can be very discouraging include not shipping projects that a junior engineer has invested time in.  Engineers that are new to a team likely already feel like their position is unstable.

One great tactic that we put into practice at Kickstarter (again, credit to the mobile team at Kickstarter, I learned so much from everyone there) is having regular engineering-only meetings where we share what we're working on, go through prs, share feedback, and learn from each other.  This isn't built into Agile in any formal way (because Agile is more about product development, not so much how to build good engineering teams), but it's a great way to integrate new people into your team.  This was especially pronounced on payments at Kickstarter because there is so much jargon that is specific to the domain that serves as an extra barrier to entry for a new engineer.
