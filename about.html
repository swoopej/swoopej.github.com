    I'm from Texas, I lived on the West Coast for 6 years, and now I live in Brooklyn, NY.  I had a close call with going to law school after college, but I escaped and learned how to program.  I recently completed Hacker School in New York, which was probably the most productive three months of my life.

    I tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/julieswoope">here</a>, cook with my friends <a href="http://cookingfoibles.posterous.com/">here</a>, and take faux vintage photos <a href="http://instagram.com/mayor_julesiani">here</a>.  You can also just <a href="mailto:julie@julieswoope.com">email me.</a></p>
