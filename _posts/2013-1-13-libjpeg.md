A few months ago I started to build a Django project that would allow users to upload images.  Seemed like a simple and common thing to build, but I ran into some apparently often encountered problems with libjpeg and the Python Imaging Library (PIL).  At the time, I remeber going through the multitude of Stack Overflow answers and not having any luck.  There is a lot of variations on a similar approach that involves installing libjpeg before you install PIL, then editing the setup.py file in PIL to change the JPEG_ROOT variable.

I finally found a solution that works for me on Mac OSX 10.7.5 here at [proteus-tech][1] via Michael Richardson's [blog][2] (which has some other suggestions).  I think the previous answers that I found were lacking configuration step of libjpeg and jumping right to installing PIL.  So, add this to the chorus of answers that have worked for different people.
