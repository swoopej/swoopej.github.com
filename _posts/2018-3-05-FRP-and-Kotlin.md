title: Talk at Functional Swift Conf 2017 FRP and Kotlin
---
this is a talk that I gave at [Functional Swift Conf 2017][1].  It's a great conference, and a lot of the credit for my talk goes to [Brandon Williams][2], one of the organizers of the conference, and my colleague [Lisa Luo][3], who helped me learn Android at Kickstarter.  I also wrote a [short post][4] about it on the Kickstarter blog.
